The year is 2016, [Kanye](https://share.google/35c7AT7l5Zcudkp90) just released the Life of the Pablo album which was all about a shift toward raw, unfinished, and emotionally vulnerable expression. While most of his songs are always about bravado, celebrity lifestyle, luxury and fame, this is unique as it strips away the ego usually associated with his persona to reveal a tired and a regretful man analyzing his failing relationships. The song features [Ty Dolla sign](https://share.google/sEVQCHKhl9U5ENmVB) which gives it the soulful, raspy bridge and backing vocals to echo Kanye's pain. The central thesis of the song is how fame commodifies relationships with Kanye exploring the tragic realization that his success has turned his family and friends into employees or opportunists.

In the song there is a Shift which juxtaposes the "old days" (when friendship was genuine) with the "new days" (where every interaction has a price tag on them). He also shows Self-Indictment Uniquely where he does not just blame others but instaed admits he is a "deadbeat cousin" who misses birthdays and family reunions. The song serves more of like an apology as it is an accusation.

In the song, Kanye raps about the Laptop Incident where he says _I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on / Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him_ As most can vew this as a metaphor, it is actually not but instaed its a real life scenario where Kanye allegedly had a laptop containing sensitive/explicit personal content stolen by a family member. He was forced to pay a "ransom" of $250,000 to his own blood relative to prevent the leak of the information that was there inn an explanation to the deep cynicism in the song. It posits the question: If your own family will blackmail you, who can you actually trust.

The hook Real friends is a reference to the Real friends song by [Whodini](https://share.google/KS6ypfjYkWUKPUJUT).
The Connection between Whodini’s song which was an upbeat and cautionary to Real Friends by Kanye is how it is slowed down to a dirge, changing the tone from "watch out for fake friends" to "I have already lost them all."

Kanye talks about the "Communion" which is a Metaphor to illustrate his disconnect from tradition and family structure. The "free wine" represents him taking advantage of situations, or perhaps being clumsy with the "grace" offered to him. Ruining the tux symbolizes ruining his public image or the "perfect occasion."

The song’s minimalist production is intentional with;

Sparse drums

Muted melody

No dramatic beat switch

This creates:

A confessional tone

A sense of emotional emptiness

Space for reflection rather than performance

Compared to louder tracks on the previous albums such as (Famous, Feedback), Real Friends acts like a quiet room where Kanye speaks without armor.

Thanks for reading!
