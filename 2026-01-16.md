### Artist: Drake

### Year of Production: 2016

### Genre: HipHop

The year is 2016 and Drake just droped his Views Album with 9 as the opening track to the project deeply tied to Toronto which is Drake’s hometown. The track was produced by 40 (Noah Shebib), Boi-1da, and Brian Alexander Morgan. By choosing this song as the album intro, Drake sets the emotional and geographical foundation for the entire record which are isolation at the top, loyalty, paranoia, and hometown pride. In the song and the album as a whole, Drake is both the narrator and central figure which reinforces the album’s inward-looking tone a sign of him speaking directly, almost unfiltered, to the listener.

The Title “9” comes from “The 6ix,” Toronto’s nickname, which itself comes from the city’s area codes (416, 647) and the former six municipalities that make up Toronto.
Calling the song “9” is a subtle flex and positions him as the embodiment of Toronto framing the album as a state-of-the-city address while also serving as a signal that the story being told is rooted in where he comes from.

At its heart, “9” is about how success breeds isolation. Drake reflects on:

- Rising from local fame to global superstardom
- Losing trust in people around him
- Feeling emotionally detached despite material success
- Carrying the weight of expectations from his city and inner circle.

In the song, Drake suggests that;

- He moves carefully
- He limits access to himself
- He assumes people have hidden motives

Rather than glorifying this mindset, the song makes it feel claustrophobic, as if fame has turned his world smaller instead of bigger.

The song has various hidden meanings ranging from it being excatly 4 minutes 16 seconds Runtime
If you look at the track length on the original version of Views, the song "9" is exactly 4 minutes and 16 seconds long which is a direct tribute to Toronto’s original area code, 416.

There is also the Jane and Weston Reference _How did I finesse all this shit from Jane and Weston?_ which refers to the intersection of Jane Street and Weston Road in Toronto. This was a rougher area where Drake lived for a period of time before moving to the more affluent Forest Hill. He is marveling at his journey from those specific streets to global stardom.
Also there is the "Ericka" Lawsuit _"I've had a lot to say since Ericka sued me"_ which is all about Ericka Lee, an ex-girlfriend who sued him claiming she was the voice on the phone in his 2011 hit "Marvin’s Room." She sought songwriter credits and a share of the royalties. This line reveals how personal betrayals and legal battles weigh on him and fuel his songwriting.

It is important to also note the [Michael Jordan (MJ)](https://share.google/RZTxd4xEnnKWs8zhZ) and "North" Connection
_I made a decision last night that I would die for it / Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it_ where Drake often compares his "reign" to Michael Jordan (MJ). Just as Jordan transformed Chicago, Drake views himself as the singular figure who transformed the "North" (Canada) in the eyes of the music industry.

“9” is not designed to be catchy instaed it’s designed to set a mood. It introduces a Drake who is successful, respected, and powerful, yet emotionally distant and perpetually on guard. In doing so, it prepares the listener for an album less about celebration and more about survival at the top.

Thanks for reading!
