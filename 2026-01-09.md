The year is 1996 and [Tupac Shakur](https://share.google/lGBRNHq4LWf1teoiY) Popularly known as 2Pac is just released from prison from a case that he was involved in a Sexual abuse. He gets out and as the icon for the [west coast](https://share.google/4oxKKSuFyhgE81lSH) the feud between them and the east coast gets even juicer now that much had happened when he was in prison such as diss tracks and other groups trying to hijack his _Thug Life_ scene.

It is important to note that it was durig this time that the beef between East coast being lead by [Death Row Records](https://share.google/UnYcHIIFzIHzjOtKG) and West coast being lead by [Bad Boy Records](https://share.google/nLm8HFjCpL9JYjVWa) lead by [Sean Combs](https://share.google/BhJ3jgDxEmusswdud) popularly know as P-Diddy. From both records, 2pac was the icon from the Death Row while [Notorious BIG](https://share.google/qDlygX7cYgNhfvvRe) popularyly known as Biggie was representing the West coast scene.

This comes at a time when Biggie had been friends with 2pac for the longest time possible and 2Pac even being the guy behind the success of Biggie from hosting him and having him sleep on his couch to introducing him to various people in the music industry.

The feud starts when 2pac gets shot 5 times while in the studio lobby in New York while Diddy and Biggie were also in the building. Pac puts the blame on them now that he believed the shooting was ochestrated if not known by the duo with even more blame on his friend Biggie who they have been close with for the longest time possible. Biggie denies knowing all that and distances himself from the drama despite Pac even having hints about the shooting from the prior song by Biggie of _Who shot Ya_ that was realsed just sometimes before the incident.

In the intro to the song, Pac raps about having no Mf friends of which is seen as a major shift now that he had have Biggie and even at that moment Evans faith who was Biggies Wife as friends even going ahead to call Biggie a fat Mf.

In the song Hit 'Em Up, Pac raps about Sleeping with Biggies enstranged wife Faith. This brings a lot of heat in the East vs West coast scene as Biggie sees this as disrepect though there were no prrof of the incident. Pac also reffers to Bad Boy Records as Bad Boy Killers tarnishing their name.

Pac also raps about having Biggie sleep on his couch as a sign that he has been betrayed by someone whom he viewed as a friend and helped launch his music career, bough him a watch and mentored him. He talkes about Biggie moving to Versace which is a direct reference to Biggie trying to emulate the Luxury Lifestyle that he had already created.

He also disses [ChinoXL](https://share.google/nYphLtqEl3e3TXCTX) (a lyrist) whom had dissed him prior to his release from Jail in one of his songs [RIIOT](https://youtu.be/FsJRn9zj2BY?si=emguDO7hzIK5PdH2) whcich Pac views as a disrespect of which Chino later explains that it was not about the disrepect of diss but just a metaphor.

He also engulfs Diddy, Junior M.A.F.I.A, [Mob Deep](https://share.google/y9je8pdrxMbnTYY7H) and Lil' Kim in the song reffering to them as "Little" side chicks to Biggie due to their close relationships which he raps about when he says, "Little as* Bi*ches". It is also important to know that Mobb Deep, Junior M.A.F.I.A, Lil' Kim were all part of the East coast scene and were close allies to Biggie who we can say was the main reason why this diss song was released.
