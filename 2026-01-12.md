### Genre: HipHop

The year is 2009 and [JAY-Z](https://share.google/PNRPLyBCjze0r7afB) just released the song as part of his Blueprint 3 album.
The song draws inspiration from the [Aphaville] (https://share.google/NbeiqM2bSLIY6ULtd) which can be said to have inspired the Jay-Z edition.
The song is like Jay is refelcting on his life now that he was around 35 years old at that time an age in which in the Hip Hop world is considered old and most artists starts getting sidelineed.
For Jay, he sees the bigger picture now that it was at those times when he had at some point retired from rap and decided to vneture fully into enterpreneurship to become a business mogul.

The song mostly reference his cultural immortality due to the impact and influence he had had in the rap industry furing his reign as a Younging.
He acknowledges the fact that he is aging, his mistakaes, losses and success.
He also questions on what actually lasts in this life of which to him seems like for him to remain relevant and timeless, he need to produce great music that will reign as long as music reains relevant in the humans life.

The word _Young_ appears in most of the lines in the music a world that most likely represents what Jay seems and expects of that age in this case is creatvity, fearlessness, cultural relevance. He explains what youthful life is to him which is all about spiritual and mental clarity and not physical as has been depicted by most.

In comparing the Aphaville 1984 song to the Jay Edition, Jays edition is all about Legacy, cultural relevance, fear of being forgotten whils that of Alphaville is all about fear of dying young now that is was published during the cold war era, surivival and paranoia. Jays, version is also not as boostful, angry as most rap songs.
