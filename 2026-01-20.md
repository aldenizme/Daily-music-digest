### Year of Production: 2010

### Genre: HipHop

The year is 2010, Teflon Don Album just dropped with "B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)" being the second single from the album.
The song title can be crossed referenced to the Black Mafia Family (BMF), a massive drug trafficking and money laundering organization founded by brothers Demetrius "Big Meech" Flenory and Terry "Southwest T" Flenory.
The song is a symbolism of Wealth, Power & Persona. It celebrates wealth, luxury, and power where he paints a vivid picture of fast money, expensive cars (like his Rolls Royce), and lavish lifestyle choices. Lines like “I think I’m Big Meech” and “Larry Hoover” explicitly link Ross’s persona to infamous hustlers, signaling swagger, success, and influence on the streets.

In the song, various names are called and it is important to note the relationship between them and Ross;

1.  Big Meech (Demetrius Flenory): Leader of the Black Mafia Family with a real drug empire which is often worn as a badge of honor in hip-hop for hustle and influence.

2.  Larry Hoover: Former leader of the Gangster Disciples which is another iconic (and incarcerated) figure referenced to symbolize respect and dominance.

Rick uses these figures metaphorically to align his narrative with the idea of being an untouchable boss. The song also weaves together street hustling imagery with aspirational success when he says, “whippin’ work, hallelujah” which acts like a connection of illegal hustle to a kind of gritty gospel to covey how ambition with survival can be blednded.

The chorus “Blowin’ money fast, put a mil’ in the stash” conveys both excess and resilience, celebrating financial gain while showing it.
