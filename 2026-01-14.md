It's 2021, the whole world is under tension from Covid and at that same moment [Drake](https://share.google/v6PCsrA8uo2uSA2sW) just release his Certified Lover Boy(CLB) Album. The song feaures the intro song, Champagne poetry which is all about Drake's way of showing his success, Luxury, Bravado while also trying to show his insecurities such as his vulnerabilities, personal struggles, anxieties and emotional tolls that comes with fame. This can be seen when he talks about Champagne a metaphorical word to reperesent success, and luxury then switching the lyrics to talk directly about his anxieties.

Some of his notable lines in the song, includes when he raps about the city being on fire and people being in denial. While the word city can have several meanings and reference points, it is important to acknowledge his previous lines in various songs and interviews when he talks about the city and always reffers to his home city Toronto though it can also be referenced to the HipHop ecosystem that is sometimes reffered as the city by the artists. Drake talking about the city being on fire likely means the hit that Covid had come with or less likely the HipHop world.
He also talks about being still able to moon walk through a mine field, which are all used metaphorically to show how he was able to navigate the chaos, drama and fame that comes with his celebrity lifestyle while still surviving the dangerous HipHop industry while still maintaining his style. He also gives a shoutout and acknowlegment to the [OVO](https://share.google/63mLAVrzGr6iDrBIY) (hie record label) lettermen boys a sign of him showing loyalty and collective success.
He raps about seeing nobody over him but seeing all the people that said they were over him, a sign of bragadacio that comes with his success in the craft and him putting himself above everyone else in the game.

Other themes that can be drawn from the song includes what most people dont view as whats actually the truth of the matter such as, when people view luxury, in reality it is always anxiety, fame for isolation, celebrations for emotional unrests and confidence for self reflection.

Thanks for reading.
