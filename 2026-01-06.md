Due to his blend of sweatness, swagger, romamce and personal growth in most of his songs, he gets reffered to as the quintessential modern reggae artiste.

The song was originally a single before being added into the _Big deal Album_.

In his song, piartes of the carribean, he uses _Pirates_ as a metaphor to reffer to various things like, in his first stanzas, he talkes about Beutiful girls being his treasure depicting he is a _pirate of Love_ depicting his Wanderlust theme. He also goes ahead to sing about what can be said to be a mataphor to represent how Carribean people survive under all odds when he talks about Jack Sparrow which can also mean how he is a bravado at Love matters. The term pirate can also be metaphorically translated to depict hw the carribeans fought to find freedom and control of themselves as they escaped slavery which had been in existence for the longest time possible.
