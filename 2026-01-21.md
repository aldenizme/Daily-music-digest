The song features a variety of Artists from the script band itself to other's like Will.I.am of the [Black Eyed Peas](https://share.google/TMDU2ZCoum9wM0yd2).

The song is about "The Everyday Hero" which the artists after seeing what groups of people were doing without the need of Papparaziz and and media coverage to come to life, decided to rewrite the true meaning of an Everyday Hero. The activities that inspired the song included people running a marathon to rfaise awareness and funds to go towards cancer traetment, disgnosis and awareness.
Unlike many songs about fame that focus on "red carpets" and "paparazzi," this song was written to redefine what a "Hall of Fame" actually is. The song was written in early 2012, leading up to the London Olympics. It was designed to capture that specific spirit of human potential and the breaking of records. The artists expresses what it takes to excel in anything eg sports, arts, community, or leadership.

The song has a lot of repetition that makes the lines catchy and reinforces the song’s motivational nature.

The song uses a variety of metaphors to convey different meanings with regards to the songs inspiration such as; _King Kong banging on your chest_ line to symbolise supreme self-confidence and overcoming the feeling of being _"too small"_ for your dreams. The song also reinforces the importance of being audacious and more vacal in demanding for the answers or success from the universe/highest power when they sings, _"Talk to God, go banging on his door"_. The artists also talkes about _"Walking straight through hell with a smile"_ to refer to the psychological state of resilience—maintaining your spirit even when your circumstances are at their worst. _Burn with the brightest flame_, is used to Compare passion and legacy to a burning flame; it conveys intensity and visibility. The _Hall of Fame_ metaphor is a symboism of achieving lasting impact and recognition, not just being famous as the literal meaning can look like.

It is important to note that the song was reportedly finished and recorded in just 90 minutes after will.i.am joined the band in the studio. The Piano Rift in the song is built on a repetitive, 4-chord piano loop to create simplicity. The simplicity is intentional as it mimics the "steady heartbeat" or the "rhythm of a runner," reinforcing the idea of persistence.
For the "Anthem" Sound, the production uses "chunky" synthesizers mixed with live drums to create a stadium-rock feel. The goal was to make it feel like an anthem for millions, not just a personal story.

The songs creative spark is said to have been from Danny O’Donoghue who was inspired after hearing about a “Hall of Fame Hour” on Classic FM and imagined a song celebrating everyday achievements, not just celebrity success and that's how the song came to existence.
