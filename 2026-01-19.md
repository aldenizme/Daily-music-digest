### Artist: Sigma Ft Rita Ora

### Year of Production: 2015

### Genre: Pop

The yaer is 2015 a major collaboration between the British drum and bass duo [Sigma (Cameron Edwards and Joe Lenzie)](https://share.google/udOwhvMGWtpqyWumx) and pop star [Rita Ora](https://share.google/DmOKpBPnXVrFWCsBZ), just dropped. The anthem is about search for belonging and the emotional exhaustion that often accompanies high-level success and constant travel. The song features Neil Cowley on piano (renowned for his work with Adele) and additional gospel-style backing vocals from Priscilla Jones and Lurine Cato, which gives the track an uplifting, spiritual quality.The song was written by Wayne Hector.

While most pop songs celebrate "living it up" and traveling the world, "Coming Home" looks at the aftermath of that lifestyle which is the exploration of the exhaustion of ego, and the Hollowness of Success. The line _All of this time I've been living it up / And all I've got left is rubble and dust_ suggests the importance of a stable home or community as the high-flying life of a celebrity feels empty after all. The _Ground Beneath My Feet_ which is a recurring phrase is a metaphor for mental and emotional stability. It represents a need to stop moving, stop performing, and reconnect with one’s original identity.

In the music video, Rita Ora is seen alone in a vast, empty mansion a visual representation of the lyric _this life that I've been living ain't my own._ which suggests that fame is a gilded cage—beautiful and expensive, but vacant and lonely. She must leave the "mansion" to find her "home" in the woods with her friends.

The Bonfire Night Release
The song was released on November 6, 2015, which is the day after Bonfire Night [Guy Fawkes Night](https://share.google/wEbFVtIbjOPaV0Vv8) in the UK.
The music video features sparklers, fireworks, and a large outdoor gathering which isn't just a random party but a specific cultural activity that represents British community and "coming together" during the cold autumn months.

Thanks for reading!
