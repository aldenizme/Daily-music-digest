The year is 2016, [Kanye West](https://share.google/A8rqnSEqKtUMrPmwD) just released his long awaited Album [Life of the Pablo](https://share.google/qXnfyOrDecSHXdyV1) which was also reffered as the _Living Album_. While the album is mostly about Kanye blending HipHop to Gospel, the song Famous stands out from all the 20 songs in the album. The song is a combination of the popular hype and bravado that exists in the HipHop community, Kanye entanglement with media drama and fight to write his legacy. The song was produced by Kanye with the help of Havoc from [Mobb Deep](https://share.google/ieqofMkrvbda9bOlM), Noah Goldstein and others. It was at this moment that Kanye was wrestling with fame, public backlash, legacy and ego and the song is the dedication of what it feel like to be famous let alone all the previllages that comes with fame. In the intro, Rihanna acts as the opener for the song despite her struggles with relationships now that she is famous. [swizz Beatz](https://share.google/ZzhFiqGotHLjpYuJ0) adds an Ad-Lib to the song to show Bravado, power, hype and dominance. To show that, there is a lot of sampling, distortion, abrupt transitions to mirror the chaos, media noise and ego that Ye is trying to potray in the song.

In the song, Kanye positions himself as both a creator and a victim of modern fame culture. He tries to explore whether fame is created, if yes, who creats it and who controls the narrative. He also tries to explore the world of notorierity of whether it is stolen, earned or mutually beneficial. Kanye can be haerd saying "...I made that bitch famous" which makes the song serve as a dual apology and a defiance of public perception following the [2009 MTV VMAs incident](https://youtu.be/PwTx1VuMlqo?si=MLQuHXc3DsLUi0Wy) where Kanye grabbed the microphone from Tylor swift to talk about Beyonce Video. The event attracted a lot of media coverage and fame for both of them. It even solidified their own relationships in the public eye.

In the song, Kanye deliberatly blurs confidence, arrogance, truth, provocation, art and offence. Here, he treats Fame as a currency equating attention to power, scandals to relevance and controversy to longevity. He views conflicts as the fuel to the sustainance of th celebrities ecosystems.

It is important to note that the song is exaggeratted to potray the loud, unapologetic and rekless Kanye as he tries to dictate the final say/legacy and not anyone else, the media or other celebrities.
